# HappyMerge
Repository with images to make the merge requests more kind and inspiring

# How to use it
Use the default search function github provides. It is definitely not perfect â€“ but it's a start

# Can I contribute
Of course! You can add new images or rename the existing ones. Because it looks like it was not me who named the pictures but rather some bear with dementia.
